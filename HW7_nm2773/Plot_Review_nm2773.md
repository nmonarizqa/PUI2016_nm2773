![plot 2](/HW7_nm2773/30daysofsummer.png)

These two plots are made by Nurvirta Monarizqa (nm2773) with clear title, legends and explaination. 

The first plot is a heatmap of Citibike ridership in June-September 2016. The plot shows the distribution of ridership clearly and the colors chosed have obvious distinctions so it is easy for readers to tell the differnce between riderships. One suggestion is to emphasize the data is the 'summary' of all the ridership everyday from Jun 1st to Sep 30th or the 'average'.

The second plotis the sparklines of daily average of Citibike data from June 1-30. With appropriate color and notes readers can know the avearge of the max and min of the following data: age, duration, riders, distance and speed. One suggestion is to make the legends more clear like 'age of riders, duration of trips, riders number, distance of trips and speed of trips'. Legend like 'riders' sometimes could be a little bit confusing.
