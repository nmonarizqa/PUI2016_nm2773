### Clarity
1. The plot is easy to read, I like the heatmap structure to illustrate the peak ridership times
2. Coloring the heatmap using blue to yellow, makes reading the intensity intuitive
3. Good use of different size title font to describe the plot
4. Need a descriptive paragraph to explain what the insights drawn from the plot are

The takeaways I got from the plot are: (1) Ridership is highest during peak am and peak pm times. (2) Weekdays, particularly tuesday through friday, are the highest ridership days

### Aesthetic
1. Color map using plasma is very aesthetically pleasing.
2. Consider changing hour from 0-23 to 1-24.

### Honesty
1. Plot does not miscontrue data, is clear and fair.

### Conclusion
Clear plot which conveys the peak ridership days and times.
