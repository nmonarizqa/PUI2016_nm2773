# HW 8

## 1. Finishing lab 8

_File: HW8_nm2773.ipynb_

I merge 311 data with infrastructure and population data. I get Manhattan 12 as the community district with the highest number of complaints. The result also suggest that there is no strong linear relationship between complaints and demographic age groups as well as number of household with high/low internet speed. 

## 2. Peer review

For this assignment, I reviewed 2 plots, one is by zz1598 and the another one by fk759. All reviews are in `Review_zz1598.md` and `Review_fk759.md` respectively within this folder, as well as in the markdown file inside HW7 folder within each peer repo.
