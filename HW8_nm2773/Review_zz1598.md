## Review

### Clarity

The plot shows good title, clear X-axis and Y-axis labels. It includes a complete legend with distinctive colors. However, I do not find the legend labels helpful, maybe because I know nothing about music so I do not know the meaning behind the names (harm_M.0.M, etc). If there is any easier way to describe the chord changes, that would be helpful.

### Aesthetic

I love the colormap and the idea to use BokehJS, but I do not find the description box convenient. When I hover at a part of a bar, it shows description but it is not complete. As shown in the picture, it shows "chord change to" that suppose to refer the chord changes but it doesn't, instead it shows "chord_change_to". So, it is better to fix that. Also, I think it will be helpful to include the values (100,200,etc) in the description box, as opposed to the song name.

### Honesty

I find the plot honest: it does not truncate the data nor hid anything. The zoom in feature allows us to zoom in to the small bars to know their values. 

### Overall

Great plot! It is very creative! Although it was confusing at first because the writer did not include the plot and I have to run the codes first to obtain the plot, the result is interesting :) In my opinion, a static stacked bar plus one for zooming in the smaller bars are enough to convey information you want to display, but anyway this is a nice try :)
