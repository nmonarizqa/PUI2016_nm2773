## Review

### Clarity

Looking at the title and plot, at the first glance, it seems the plot will be easy to read and simple. But turns out, it is not as clear as I expected. I think the axis were swapped: the X-axis should be the month and number of felonies should be placed in Y-axis beacuse it does not make sense to have month over 2000. The placement for the x-axis ticks should be better as well, placing the numbers right below **the center of the bar** as opposed to the corner of the bar, mentioning all months (instead of every 2 steps/months), and removing the "14" in the end of X-axis to make it clear. Or, better yet, the writer could replace the numbers with months (January, February, etc.)

### Aesthetic

The background and foreground (bars) are contrast with each other so it is good. 

### Honesty

Since the Y-axis was truncated at 10000 and most of the bars are at the same height (almost 10000) it is hard to differentiate their values and as they are too close to 10000, I was wondering is there any bar accidentaly truncated as well. So in my opinion, it is better to show the Y-axis up to 10-20% of the max-Y of data, or in this case, because the writer wants to show "function" or progress, I think visualize the data with line plot will be more meaningful than bar plot. If the writer want to retain the bar plot, it will be more helpful to put the values inside each bar as opposed to the Y-axis, as the differences are not that big. If using line plot, the writer might include denser grid to emphasize the differences.
